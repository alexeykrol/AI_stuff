My name is Alex, I live in Silicon Valley, USA and I create a lot of content, including text and video lectures. But let's face it, sometimes translating or transcribing all of it into English can be a real pain. It's time-consuming and can be expensive to hire people to do it for you. 

That's where these helpful utilities come in! They're designed to make your life easier by automating the tedious work of translating, transcribing, summarizing, and creating captions for your videos. And the best part? 

All of these tools are written in Python and make use of some awesome Open AI API features. So, why not give them a try and see how much time and effort you can save?

I'm not a programmer, meaning that I used to create microprocessor systems and have a basic understanding of coding, but that was a while ago. Instead of coding that controls computers, I create text that guides people and helps them change their lives. However, I do recognize the vast potential that coding skills offer.

My coding partner is ChatGPT. In our collaboration, I act as the product owner, setting tasks, testing the code to make sure it works as intended and does exactly what I want it to do. ChatGPT serves as the developer, mentor, consultant, and teacher all at once. I couldn't create amazing things without such a helpful assistant. Thanks to everyone who made this opportunity possible.

I learned everything I know from scratch, and my amazing teacher was none other than ChatGPT! I didn't need any other resources or guides. Even when I use third-party services and don't understand something, ChatGPT always has the best answers.

If I can learn all of this at almost 60 years old, so can you. I do have a strong technical background and hold a degree in Information Systems, but professionally, I worked over 30 years ago. So, you could say that I'm starting from scratch, too!

Don't be afraid to learn something new and don't hesitate to ask ChatGPT for help. With a little effort and the right guidance, you can achieve anything you set your mind to. Let's learn and grow together!
