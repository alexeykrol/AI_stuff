"When we talk to someone significantly older than ourselves, we fall into cognitive distortion.","When we talk to someone significantly older than ourselves, we fall into a cognitive distortion. We automatically think that we are talking to the past, when in fact we are talking to the future, but few are able to realize and use this. Many things change, but the most important things in our life probably remain the same. When you talk to your parents or grandparents, try to imagine that you are talking to someone from the distant future. You may be able to learn something very important, even though they don't know how to use gadgets."
The greatest value is time. With a loved one...,"If people come to you in various situations with the question: ""What should I do?"", and you sincerely want to help them, then first ask: ""What do you want to achieve?"". There can be many ways to a goal. And if you understand the goal, resources, and context, you can suggest the most relevant method. However, the greatest benefit of this question is that it puts 99% of people in a cognitive impasse, forcing them to ask themselves: ""What do I really want?"" ""What do I want?""
These questions lead to the following questions: ""What is the situation? Where am I now? What is important to me?""
If a person at least tries to formulate answers, there is a high probability that he will understand how to achieve his goal. The problem is that for most people, it is easier to do simple and understandable things, despite the fact that such actions can be absolutely MEANINGLESS and INEFFECTIVE. We prefer to do what is CLEAR, FAMILIAR, and CONVENIENT, instead of doing what LEADS TO RESULTS. And then, at the end of life, at the coffin board, we ask ourselves: ""How did it happen that I WORKED HONESTLY ALL MY LIFE, but there is no use?""

If you realize that the greatest value is time, then before you spend it, ask yourself: ""Will this lead to what my soul truly strives for?"""
If you want to sell - don't be afraid to make huge promises for several reasons..txt,"1. People WANT to believe in BIG promises, and they don't pay attention to small ones. 2. When you create an offer, think about those who WANT to get EXACTLY such an offer, not about fools who will consider you a fraud. 3. Understand, 99% of all people on the planet in ANY case and ALWAYS will consider you a fraud for the simple reason that you can do what they don't have the balls for. They are insignificant and spitting at you is the only way they can alleviate their miserable lives. So send them to hell and don't waste your time on them. 4. Always raise the stakes and don't allow compromises. Are you scared yourself? But this is exactly how you can learn and grow. Are you promising people something that you don't have and don't know how and where to get? Really? This obligation makes your eyes pop, not just out of your pants, but out of your skin. You start asking the right questions. Your fearful personality dies in agony, and in its place a new personality is born, and it's not a human. It's a damn predator! And everything around is its prey, and the world is its hunting ground. Who do you want to be? A predator or the prey of other predators? However, you can also become a robot))). Some say that it hurts less when a predator is eating you."
Two features of a goal worth spending time on..txt,"It is well known that in order to develop, one must have a goal, but there can be many types of goals. How do you determine if your goal is the one worth spending your energy and nerves on? Your goal should evoke two emotions in you...

1. Overwhelming delight and promise. There should be a willingness to sacrifice a lot for the sake of attaining and achieving the goal. This is clear, it is the basis of motivation,
and the second feeling is...
2. Deadly terror and complete certainty - in the IMPOSSIBILITY of achieving it. Important posts that are similar in meaning, which you should definitely read, because these ideas will seriously change your life:"
"In your opinion, what is the most effective way to transform a personality?.txt","First, get rid of the nonsense about work-life balance. It's a myth. It doesn't exist, except in cases where we reach a level where we can manage our time without losing income. Balance is a luxury for the rich, and the poor and slaves have no balance and cannot have it. The best way to transform a personality is through a task that you cannot solve, precisely because your personality does not allow you to do it. For this, you need to focus as much as possible and start solving this task. Any boxing, oratory art is much worse than business. You have a problem in business, so solve it. Set a goal for yourself to double sales in a month, and ... focus hard on it. Come up with some commitment to yourself. Don't eat, don't go to the movies, don't play, don't watch movies. Seriously, deprive yourself of something. All life is for the sake of achieving a goal. Only then will something start to move. There is no other way. Our personality is changed by the attempt to jump above our head, this is going beyond the limits of the old personality, the death of the old personality and the creation of a new one."
When you're at a dead end and don't know what to do? The simplest method..txt,"Formulate key questions in the format of HOW, WHAT? What do you want? Formulation of the task. 1. Write it down and hang it in a visible place. 2. Calm down. If you are anxious - NOTHING will happen. Don't try to find a solution immediately. Don't panic. 3. Every day for 5-10 minutes once a day, ask yourself THESE questions and glance at the wall where your questions are hanging. This sends the problem from the conscious to the subconscious. You continue to work, and the subconscious is working. 4. The main thing is to focus every day. If new questions arise - add them to the list. 5. In a few days, ideas will start to emerge. Then gradually you will start noticing some solutions. 6. Then you will start meeting the right people. 7. Don't lose focus, write down ideas and new questions. The first ideas will come in 2-5 days, then the flow will increase. Within 1-2 months, or maybe earlier, a solution will be found that will allow you to take a step. 8. Repeat the iteration. Step by step, you will solve all the problems. Some are faster, some are slower."
Argument Against Meaning..txt,"Empires could be built on the basis of any false meanings, for people follow not the meaning, but the myth and the hero, the legend, the promise. Ignorance is the basis of governance - in the past and now. Nothing has changed. If it were otherwise, empires would not have crumbled to dust, for their foundation was not built on truth, but on the myth of truth. That's why, if someone says they are right because they are great, it can in no way be a basis for trust. We, like nations, are just streams in different phases. To say that the crest of the wave will stand forever just because it is great, is to show ignorance. Human authority, the presence of power, positions, states speak more about the effectiveness of politics and the management of mass relations, about the social position, but not about the righteousness."
Why should we desire more and what prevents us from setting ambitious goals?.txt,"Why should we aspire for more and what prevents us from setting ambitious goals? The question, you see, is not about greed, but about common sense. This can be called the wind of reality. The wind of reality constantly blows in our face in the form of internal doubts, procrastinations, unpleasant surprises, endless delays, and unpleasant obstacles. This means that we always try to accomplish less than we planned. That's why we need to set high enough goals. The second important reason why we should desire more is that sometimes the value of high goals is not in the goals themselves, but in the changes that occur in our personality when we achieve these goals. High ambitious goals immediately highlight at least two points:

- the fact that we have no idea how to do it, and...
- our natural insecurity and weakness. Prolonging our ignorance forces us to learn intensively. And the higher the goals we set, the more we force ourselves to think differently. High goals are achieved not because we strain ourselves, but because we are capable of moving DIFFERENTLY."
What is the difference between a leader and a businessman?.txt,"The difference between a leader and a businessman is that the latter is looking for where to invest resources, while the leader creates meanings that attract these resources. Beginning entrepreneurs spend a lot of time looking for investments, while it is more effective to invest time in creation - money will follow, because it has nowhere else to go. 
The popularity of investing in crypto is explained by the severe shortage of truly meaningful projects. 
A weak investor looks for exits, a strong one for development."
"What does the Player look at, and what does the Character look at when analyzing the text?.txt","The player looks at the text, paying attention to its content, connections. The character immerses himself in the plot of the text and becomes its slave. The player looks at how the text affects a person, and explores the text and plot as a tool, like a samurai who admires his sword. The player does not allow the plot to capture him, although he is able to distinguish a predatory plot from a plot - a cow, which peacefully grazes in the meadow. Every time you feel that a text changes your emotions, provokes reactions, you are dealing with a predatory text. Don't allow yourself to get involved, it's ALWAYS A GAME, it's ALWAYS control. Explore the triggers. ""Docked - no!"". I constantly create predatory texts, virus texts. This is how I learn to recognize predators around me, and successfully compete for the attention of Characters, which I also wish for you. Text is a code. ... In the beginning was the word. There is no meaning, there are only reasonable plots, which are also Ideas, which are also Angels, Demons, in short... you understand. You don't have to believe in this. You don't have to believe at all. It's forbidden. Allow it! Observe, and you will start to notice, and then see. We do not see most of the world, because we see not with our eyes, but with our mind, and the mind is just a labyrinth of corridors and closed doors."
People are the only thing worth paying attention to..txt,"1. Our life is a chain of relationships. Our position in society is the result of relationships. Nothing happens in our life, no significant change in our position, without contact with some person. Therefore, the path in life is a chain of communicative transactions, and the interval between them is the understanding of past contacts and preparation for future contacts. 2. Therefore, it is important to focus correctly in life - concentrate on what drives you, not on what is just preparation. This is a fundamental point of the methodology. 3. We live in a world where there are only people. And everything else that surrounds them is nothing. Even money without people is just a pack of paper. Money and everything else only has value because people give it value, proportional to the potential to generate new value. 4. Without people, there are no values, no financial prosperity, no social status. Therefore, advancement towards success in social and financial terms is always advancement within the human hierarchy, advancement through a chain of contacts. 5. As a result, you either increase your social capitalization or decrease it. 6. Everything depends only on what and how you communicate with people. 7. Success is a sign of understanding and implementing this doctrine. 8. The one who knows how to establish contacts with people, who can influence people, achieve the reactions and actions he needs from them - will succeed."
What does growth look like?.txt,"Initially, a person is uneducated, he does not understand either the world or the necessary skills. He only has access to physical labor, so he will always be in the caste of a slave. But if he starts to learn, he gradually transitions into the Role of a Specialist. This gives him a different perspective. He begins to see different levels of existence, he begins to realize goals and tasks, he can purposefully improve himself to rise. Therefore, he is growing professionally, and it is best to do this by teaching others, then learning to sell, including himself. That is, a person moves through the roles of a specialist, a teacher (authority) to the role of a salesman. This role is key, as this is where a fork appears. A person can go the path of professional development and enter the free market, that is, it is here that he gets the opportunity to move into the caste of professionals or merchants. But he lacks the knowledge to start building wealth. He sells, earns, and spends. He doesn't know how to accumulate and build. Therefore, he can only enter the higher caste of businessmen by acquiring new knowledge and skills, essentially becoming a manager. Then he can enter the caste of Businessmen if he manages to build a social and financial status. At this stage, the businessman-manager reaches the limits of organic growth and further business development proceeds through financial investment. And having created a financial-industrial empire, a person realizes that he is connected with power and society, so he begins to make his way into politics."
Time objectively does not exist..txt,"Reflections lead me to the hypothesis that time does not objectively exist, but is merely a subjective epiphenomenon of how our consciousness reflects the observed world. We operate with concepts such as: 
- the past (that which is in memory), 
- the present (what we see directly),
- the future - this is the flow of events manifested in what we call the present. The past is what we no longer see, the future is what we have not yet seen. But this vector is determined only by what we divide by the direction of the cause-and-effect relationship - respectively forward or backward. But this connection and sequence is determined by our perception, so even when observing the world through devices, we cannot change anything. Perhaps we live in an objective world, but consciousness is a prisoner of perception. And what we see determines how we express our will and act. And this has nothing to do with what surrounds us. The beginning and end of events are also conditional, just like what we observe on the surface of objects. If we are able to go beyond the boundaries of perception, then we are able to see a more complex topology of reality, and therefore, act in a way that seems unthinkable. But people will not associate the consequences with us, because the cause-and-effect relationships lie on other surfaces. The problem, however, is that changing perception and developing the ability to act are different things. Therefore, even when we see something, we are unable to influence or interpret it, and therefore we do not believe in what is revealed to us. And revelations, for the most part, appear to us as soap bubbles. Not because they are like that, but because we do not have the strength to accept what is revealed to us."
The Second Law of Growth..txt,"The amount of effort you put in to reach the next level of business or hierarchy is always constant and does not depend on the level of business. Implication #1: Aim to reach the highest level immediately. Settle for a lower one only if it is an intermediate step to reach a higher level. Implication #2: Stay at the intermediate level no longer than the time you need to reach a higher level. Conclusion #3: The main thing you should gain at the intermediate level is the opportunity to reach a higher one. The compensation package and other things are secondary factors. Keep this in mind when choosing between the opportunity for growth and the size of the compensation package. Your profit from being at the intermediate level is not in money, but in career growth, so your financial losses at this level will be more than compensated at the next stage. Therefore, being at an intermediate level should be considered as investing in short-term highly liquid bonds. You buy them not very expensive at the intermediate level, and sell them significantly more expensive at the next one. Conclusion #4: With constant costs for reaching the desired level, only how you do it matters, namely originality and non-standard approach."
Metaphysical hypothesis about the role of the meaning of life in aging..txt,"If a person has a purpose in life, a mission, very strong and specific types of activities with peaks of distress, it triggers biophysical processes that are capable of increasing resistance to diseases and pathogenic factors, enhancing the body's ability to self-heal, increasing active longevity, and delaying dementia. Statistical data confirm this with a high degree of correlation. A reverse effect is also observed. The absence of a purpose in life, low levels of activity trigger degenerative processes that quickly lead to death, an example being severe forms of depression with a frustrating nature. Even if we find a way to bypass apoptosis and the Hayflick limit at the cellular level, it does not guarantee an increase in lifespan in conditions of a lack of purpose or existential crisis. A completely metaphysical hypothesis arises: an entity that has no intention and motivation to exist, automatically disintegrates and turns into nothing. Motivation, the reason to live - is a kind of binding energy, which not only makes one act, but also makes one exist, because any physical entity consumes energy. The essence of this energy is will, motivation, and as soon as this will disappears, the entity soon perishes. In inanimate systems, this process takes a very long time, in biological systems - faster, in mental systems - even faster. This principle can be interpreted as there being a level of energy that ensures the very existence of systems, and this is the energy of meaning, which descends from above. How to motivate people who are retiring to engage in research, a specific complex activity? On a regular basis?"
"Get out of dead ends, it's dangerous there..txt","Persistence and stubbornly doing work that only ensures survival - have nothing in common. According to the metaphor of flows and dead ends, one should be persistent in moving in the flow, in creating better worlds, in development. If you are in a dead end, and stubbornly spend energy there, getting nothing in return, then this is wrong. The reasons - why you are there, can vary. But, as a rule, the presence of a transition barrier - fatigue, scarcity of resources, location, social status, lack of will. However, in such dead ends, one must make every effort to get out of there. There is no development there. Moreover, such worlds are rarely stable and people there turn into expendable material. If you feel that you are stuck in a dead end - get out and look for a flow. Even if it's pleasant in the dead end. There is death and degradation there."
Simple lesson that games teach us..txt,"Everything that needs to be done is to look for a way - to try, to explore, to dig through forums, to ask, to watch walkthroughs. This helps in 90% of cases, but in good games, peeking at a hack is not enough. Skill is still needed, and that only comes with practice. What does this mean in life? You will never complete the game if you:

- read motivational books,
- attend seminars,
- take courses,
- pay consultants,
- meditate in the mountains,
- stop eating meat,
- draw visualizations,
- whisper mantras,
- invoke affirmations,
- inquire from the experienced,
- read philosophers,
- play other games,
- watch TV series,
- hang out on social networks,
- drink beer with friends,
- pour your heart out to a psychotherapist
- do another 100000000 things. You will simply be flushing time down the toilet. What do you need to complete a game? Just play the game, going through the challenge as many times as it takes until your level allows you to complete it. You can't do anything else. If you spend 100% of your time on the challenge, you will progress quickly. If you spend 1% of your time, and all the rest on the above-mentioned, then you won't have time to complete the game, and you will die of old age. Instead of a game, you can substitute business, science, creativity. Any talk about balance and everything else is a lie and deception. Only 100% focus. For how long? Unknown. The journey will be 10,000 hours. Impeccable intention, and no compromises or speculations. Until you stop lying to yourself - nothing will happen."
How to stop searching for the meaning of life and start living?.txt,"There are no external meanings - these are just external conditions or rules. We ourselves determine whether to follow meanings, use or overcome them. No one says that overcoming external circumstances and rules is easy, but it is possible, and it is a matter of practice. The main thing is the choice a person makes - to live in the universe where he found himself, to seek another universe or to build a new universe? Meaning is not an idea, it is a feeling and emotion of significance. This is the connection of a certain idea with a sense of hope, promise, perspective, future, or a sense of liberation, salvation. Emotion, sensation endow any idea with the status of life's meaning. Therefore, every person can easily create a life's meaning in any matter if they link the idea with a sense of hope, promise, perspective, future, or a sense of liberation, salvation. This is not objective - it's just a mental exercise. Therefore, if you cannot find the meaning of life, just create a meaning. The best way to know the future is to create it. If you understand this, then your attempts to seek meaning, instead of creating it, will cease. And your life will change. Instead of pondering the meaning, you will start to act. Sometimes you think you can't create meaning. However, you can easily understand what gives you a sense of hope, promise, perspective, future, or a sense of deliverance, salvation. Describe this in your mind and attach it to any task. And this task will immediately become the meaning of life. If you can't even do that, then formulate desires, at least the simplest ones. If it's really difficult, find an existential coach. The meaning of a person's life is that he himself determines it."
